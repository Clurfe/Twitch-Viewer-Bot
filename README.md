This software allows you to send viewers to your Twitch live stream without the need for a proxy. The way it works is through Selenium, which enters proxy sites, types the channel name, and then reduces the stream quality to 160p. This allows you to connect to the live stream as a viewer through a proxy without having to pay for one.

‚ö†Ô∏è it is recommended to use this software on another computer (not the one you are streaming from) or on a computer with a large amount of RAM because it opens a lot of hidden tabs in the background and can send as many viewers as you want to the stream.
